A basic example of hacking a server, using brute force and `itertools`
# Usage

1. Make sure you have python 3 installed
2. Run the server first, as thats the attack target using `python server.py`
3. Create another terminal and run the client code using `python hack.py`
4. You should now see the password that cracked the server :)
